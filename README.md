# Worksquare Senior Mobile App Developer Vetting Task

Welcome to the vetting assessment for **Senior Mobile App Developers** at Worksquare.

This task is meant to assess your skills in building a modern, mobile-first housing listings interface. We're particularly interested in your ability to structure mobile apps, manage state effectively, and design an intuitive user experience.

---

##  Objective

Build a housing listings app using either **React Native** (with or without Expo) or **Flutter**.  
The app should display a list of available properties in a user-friendly format, with support for filtering by **location** and **property type**.

---

##  Tech Stack

Choose **one** of the following:

- React Native (with functional components and Hooks)
- Flutter (with null safety and modern best practices)

---

##  Requirements

- Load housing data from a provided `listings.json` file
- Display listings in a scrollable, responsive layout (list/grid)
- Implement **filters or search** for:
  - Location
  - Property Type
- Handle **loading** and **empty** states gracefully
- Include **UI animations or transitions** (e.g. loading shimmer, button feedback, list item animations)
- Use clean, modular code architecture
- Style with platform-specific best practices (or Tailwind-like utility frameworks where supported)
- Ensure the UI looks good across different screen sizes

---

##  Project Structure & Architecture

You should include a `docs/` folder or describe in the `README.md`:

- Component structure and folder organization
-  State management approach (e.g. Redux, Context API, Riverpod, Provider) and your reasoning
-  Any UI/UX design decisions and rationale
-  Screenshot(s) or design inspiration (optional)

---

##  Documentation Checklist

Your final submission should include the following in the `README.md`:

- How to set up and run the app
- Tools and libraries used (e.g. navigation, state management, animation)
- Description of your approach and thought process
- Any limitations, trade-offs, or features you would improve
- Where and how AI was used (if applicable)
- Screenshots or screen recordings (optional but encouraged)

---

##  What We're Evaluating

- Clean, maintainable, and scalable code
- Logical and modular folder structure
- Intuitive user interface and smooth experience
- Creative problem-solving and developer reasoning
- Good Git commit history (granular and descriptive commits)

---

##  Submission Instructions

1. **Fork this repository**
2. Set up your mobile app project inside the fork (no starter files are provided)
3. Work in a branch named after your **GitHub handle**
4. Push your final code to GitHub
5. Send us an email with the following:
   - GitHub repository link
   - Live demo link (e.g. Expo, APK file, or TestFlight)
   - Any relevant notes or context about your work

---

##  Deadline

You have **48 hours** to complete and submit the task from the time it is assigned.

---

##  Data File

You will receive a `listings.json` file separately.  
Copy it into your local project and use it as your data source.

---

##  AI Usage Disclaimer

You are welcome to use AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) to assist with the task.  
If you do, please document **where and how** AI was used — this does not count against you.
